                  and Game Engines out there. I didn't like any of them. They are just not made for me.
                  Infact, I started not liking Game Engines and gradually, ended up hating them. To me,
                  it seems like those engines only gave a limited set of tools and it doesn't feel enough

                  <br>On the other hand, I always avoided programming and never even considered learning

                  It started out as mining, placing the blocks and crafting.
                  But I ended up loving Redstones and later on, Command Blocks.

                  Minecraft's Command Blocks are similar to programming". This made me
                  want to try learning programming. I searched for the easiest programming language

                  Ahh, I regret it. I thought that this is the Ultimate Game Development Language.
                  Little did I know that Java is umm... not for that. <i class="icofont-stuck-out-tongue"></i>
                  But I ended up liking JavaFX. It was actually fun. I really liked the structure of JavaFX
                  and I made 2-3 simple and tiny games with it. At that time, it was a big achievement to me!</p>

                  This guy rocks! I love those dangling pointers. The thing is, for the first time,
                  I felt like I truly understood how computers work behind the scenes.
                  <br>
                  <br>The moment I learned functions (yeah, I didn't finished learning Java hehe),
                  I started makingmy first animated text based game called <b>Console Platformer</b>
                  which took me 3 months after which I stopped and...

                <p class="gameDetails" id="timeline5">...started learning how the heck can I use graphics and make true video games!
                  At that time, I have an Android mobile and that device is available to me more
                  than my computer.
                  <br>
                  <br>So, I ended up installing C4Droid which only supported SDL2 at
                  that time (actually, I made Console Platformer in it but I didn't know that I could
                  do SDL2 with it) and started making my first true spagetti 'coded' video game called
                  <b>Blast Thru</b> which is inspired by an arkanoid called Blast Thru (same name, 
                  too much creativity involed here).
                  <br>
                  <br>It also took me 3 months. Then, I finally
                  learned Object Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc) and
                  it was like a blow on my face. I realized my game could have been finished in like 3
                  weeks if I have used OOP. Seriously!

                  mobile via their official Android app. I could also write shaders unlike SDL2.
                  <br>
                  <br>But the Lua language didn't suit me. I am just not used to NOT using semi-colons and

                  He doesn't like programming and I helped him on a lot of occasions. Then, he took a course
                  in Game Programming because he knows that he could call me for help as I am super interested
                  in Game Development.
                  <br>
                  <br>His Game Programming course includes Unity and naturally, he called me to help him in doing
                  some of Unity stuff. But I resisted strongly. At that point, I hated Game Engines <em>especially
                  Unity</em>. I know that Unity sucks and I have played games made with Unity that sucks as well.
                  <br>
                  <br>But my brother insisted. I tried Unity. And there you go. I liked Unity <em>a lot</em>.
                  To a Game Programmer like me, Unity is exactly what a blank sheet of paper is, for a writer.

                  Ofcourse, it attracted my attention. I always liked the idea of developing my own Android
                  apps and I have tried to do it with Java before but I ended up not liking it. To me,
                  it was just a huge mess.
                  <br>
                  <br>But Kotlin drew my attention back to Android App Development.
                  It is much better than Java. I made 2-3 simple apps with it but nothing much. I was too much
                  into Game Development and gradually, Kotlin faded away for me.</p>

                  engine with Unity-like features that have excellent 2D support and amazing structure to
                  everything.I really liked the concept of nodes. But with that said, I still use Unity
                  for my primary Game Dev. Although, it is still not capable enough like Unity but it is
                  quite easy to see that Godot is only here to get better and better.</p>

                <p class="gameDetails" id="timeline11">I am an MBBS student and don't belong to the field of computers professionally. I am a
                  self taught game programmer. I always felt like I am not good enough and my society
                  never really liked me as a programmer. They would probably say, 'yeah, cool' when I tell them
                  that I am a programmer. But the reality is that, no one would like me to leave my medical
                  studies for the sake of becoming a game developer with no certification or degree.
                  <br>
                  <br>Therefore, I never had any confidence in any of the programming and games
                  that I made in the past. I never had anyone to whom I could share my programming
                  experiences and/or develop games with them. To me or to anyone in my position, that
                  is a big let down. But somehow, I kept doing little bit of game programming.
                  <br>
                  <br>I started joining remote Game Jams at itch.io platform. There, I made <b>Develomare</b>
                  which actually represented my situation. I got really positive comments on the game which
                  made me want to join even more game jams.
                  <br>
                  <br>I made <b>Samurai Duel</b> in a game jam hosted by Extra Credits. This jam do not have
                  any competition. But Gamkedo club (now, called HT GD Club) were cohosts of this jam. <b>Chris Deleon</b>,
                  Founder of HT GD Club, liked my game and emailed me that I can join his club.

                  process is so smooth and hot reloading is such a time saver. Flutter and Dart programming language
                  may look complex at a glance but it is so neat and flexible. The concept of Widgets in Flutter
